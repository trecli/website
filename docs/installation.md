Install Trecli with `npm`:

```bash
npm install --global trecli
```

We're using `npm` but you can use `yarn` if you want:

```bash
yarn global add trecli
```

We highly recommend you to install Trecli with one of the methods above but it is also possible to run our tool without installation:

```bash
npx trecli <ComponentName>
```
