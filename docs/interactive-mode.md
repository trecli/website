Interactive mode is helpful if you don't remember available command options. Trecli will just guide you.

To run Trecli in interactive mode use command:

```bash
trecli --interactive
```

or simply:

```bash
trecli -i
```

Note: In interactive mode properties from [configuration file](configuration-file.md) will be used as question defaults.
