title: What "Trecli" means?
---

"Trecli" isn't a Nguni Bantu term. To be honest "Trecli" means nothing. All npm package names that are combination of word "typescript", "react" and "cli" were already taken so we had to soar to the heights of creativity.

We took one letter from "typescript", two letters from "react" and all three letters from "cli" and this is how "trecli" was born.
